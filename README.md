This is the first sprint of my Software engineering journey @ALX. We solely focused on C language for 3 months.
We extensively learnt the dynamism and functionality of C language. The following are hands on projects that we were assigned at the end of each topic.
This is what I learnt: 

  1. C variables - Containers for storing data
  
  2. Functions nested loops
  
  3. Debugging in C
  
  4. How pointers, arrays and strings work together
  
  5. Recursion in C - A functions that call itself from inside
  
  6. Static libraries - They are compiled object files containing all symbols required by the main program to operate (functions, variables etc.) as opposed to having to pull in separate entities.
  
  7. argc & argv - argc (argument count) is an integer that indicates how many arguments were entered on the command line when the program was started.
                   argv (argument vector), is an array of pointers to arrays of character objects.
                   
  8. malloc - The unique concept of memory allocation in C
  
  9. preprocessor - A program that processes its input data to produce output that is used as input to another program. The directives start with #. Eg #define
  
 10. Structures typedef - Allow users to provide alternative names for the primitive (e.g., int) and user-defined (e.g struct) data types.
 
 11. function pointers - Is a variable that stores the address of a function that can later be called through that function pointer.
 
 12. Variadic functions - Is one that takes a variable number of arguments. A common example is the printf() function defined in the <stdio.h> header
 
 13. Singly linked lists - a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.
 
 14. Bit manipulation - Is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a byte
 
 15. file I/O - I/O (Input and Output) It is used to transfer data items in succession
